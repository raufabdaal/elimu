## 2026-07-19 — Full UI/UX & Gamification Overhaul + 4-Class / 4-Subject NCDC Architecture Prep

### Comprehensive Design Psychology & Gamified Interface Overhaul
- **Editorial & Gamification Visual Tokens (`globals.css`)** — Rebuilt CSS foundation with crisp high-contrast typography (`DM Sans` + `Newsreader`), distinct 4-subject color identities, and tactile Duolingo-style 3D buttons (`border-b-4`, active press-down transitions).
- **Responsive Layout (`AppShell`, `TabBar`, `PhoneShell`)** — Fixed desktop/tablet centered container alignment (`max-w-[460px]`, `border-radius: 36px`) so the navigation bar docks perfectly inside the phone stage without overlapping wide monitors (`fixed sm:absolute bottom-0`).
- **Gamified Sticky Top Bar (`HeaderStats.tsx`)** — Created a unified top bar for all screens featuring:
  - Dynamic **Primary Class Switcher Modal** (`P4`, `P5`, `P6`, `P7`) with instant curriculum preview.
  - ❤️ **Hearts counter (`Hearts.tsx`)** with shake animation (`animate-shake`) triggered on incorrect answers.
  - 🔥 **Streak counter (`Streak.tsx`)** with animated flame effect.
- **Fixed Bottom Feedback Sheet (`feedback-sheet`)** — Replaced inline DOM shifts on `/module` and `/practice` with a fixed bottom feedback drawer that slides up upon answering:
  - **Correct State (`ok`)**: Emerald theme, explanation/deep dive, and auto-focused **`Continue →`** (`Enter` shortcut).
  - **Incorrect State (`bad`)**: Rose theme, clear explanation of errors + deep dive, and **`Got it →`**.
- **Interactive Question Mechanics (`src/components/question-types/*`)**:
  - `MultipleChoice` / `TrueFalse` — Tactile 3D cards with letter badges (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`) and animated check/cross feedback.
  - `MultiSelect` — Clear multi-option selection with checkmarks and missed-item alerts.
  - `Ordering` — Numbered sequence cards (`#1`, `#2`, `#3`) with smooth layout animations (`framer-motion layout`) and tactile Up/Down chevrons.
  - `Matching` — Bi-directional visual matching board with color-coded pair tags (`Blue`, `Purple`, `Amber`, `Rose`, `Teal`) and one-tap unmatch/reset capability.
  - `ShortAnswer` — High-visibility input with instant hint banner (`HelpCircle`) and submit button.

### Multi-Class & 4-Subject Curriculum Architecture Expansion
- **Expanded Types & Data Model (`types.ts`, `data.ts`)** — Upgraded system from 1 class / 2 subjects (`SST`, `Math`) to the full **4 Primary Classes (`p4`, `p5`, `p6`, `p7`)** and **4 Core NCDC Subjects (`math`, `sst`, `sci`, `eng`)**:
  1. **Mathematics (`math`)** — Indigo/Sapphire theme (`SUBJECT_THEMES.math`)
  2. **Social Studies (`sst`)** — Amber/Orange theme (`SUBJECT_THEMES.sst`)
  3. **Integrated Science (`sci`)** — Emerald/Teal theme (`SUBJECT_THEMES.sci`)
  4. **English Language (`eng`)** — Rose/Pink theme (`SUBJECT_THEMES.eng`)
- **Preserved & Expanded Curriculum Content** — Preserved all 39 canonical P7 Social Studies questions (`p7-uganda-session-1`, `2`, `3`) and introduced interactive starter topics across `P4–P7` (including playable `p5-math-fractions`, `p5-sci-humanbody`, `p5-eng-tenses`).
- **Parent Portal (`/parent/`)** — Upgraded with 4-subject progress trackers, 7-day study activity chart (`BarChart2`), and interactive **"Send Live Encouragement"** (`🙌 High Five`, `🔥 Keep the Streak`, `🌟 Super Scholar`) that triggers in-app cheers.

## 2026-07-16 — Gamification & Engagement Polish

### New Features
- **Hearts & Energy indicators** on topic rows in `/subjects` (Duolingo-style visual feedback)
- **Energy consumption system** — Every quiz attempt now costs 8 energy (via `consumeEnergy()`)
- **Enhanced sound library** (`src/lib/sounds.ts`):
  - `playHeartLossSound()` — low dramatic tone when losing a heart
  - `playStreakSound()` — celebratory rising arpeggio
  - `playLevelUpSound()` — satisfying progression tone
  - `playButtonClick()` — subtle UI feedback
- **Wrong answer flow** now plays both `playWrongSound()` + `playHeartLossSound()`

### Improvements
- Integrated sounds into both `/module` and `/practice`
- Energy system added to store with `consumeEnergy()`
- Topic rows now show ❤️ 3/5 + ⚡ 80 indicators

### Files Modified
- `src/lib/sounds.ts`
- `src/lib/store.ts`
- `src/app/subjects/page.tsx`

## 2026-07-16 — Polish & Real Content Prep

### Changes
- **Persistent bottom navbar** — Now fixed at bottom with proper role-based tabs (learners see Home/Subjects/Practice, parents see Home/Parent)
- **Role-aware navigation** — Kids no longer see Parent tab; parents no longer see Subjects/Practice
- **Demo banner** — Added persistent "🚧 DEMO MODE — Sample content only" banner at the top of the app
- **Satisfying sounds** — Added Duolingo-style audio feedback (`/src/lib/sounds.ts`):
  - Correct answer: pleasant rising tone
  - Wrong answer: low sawtooth tone
  - Encouragement toast now triggers sound
- **Encouragement toast fix** — Improved timing and animation to prevent persistence across questions
- **Cleaned workspace** — Removed `assets/` folder (design exports no longer needed)
- **TabBar** — Converted to fixed position + role filtering
- **AppShell** — Now accepts `role` prop and passes it to TabBar

### Next steps
Ready to start replacing filler curriculum with real Ugandan P4–P7 content.
